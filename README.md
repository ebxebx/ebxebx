# 👋 Hi, I'm Zeon

> I turn coffee into C code and bugs into lessons.

I'm a **systems programming learner** with a strong focus on **C, Linux, and low-level fundamentals**.  
I enjoy breaking complex problems into small, understandable pieces — and then rebuilding them better.

Currently deep-diving into:
- Unix processes & file descriptors  
- Memory management  
- Shell behavior & pipelines  
- Algorithmic thinking  
- Clean, defensive C code  

---

## 🧠 What I’m Studying

- Systems Programming (C / POSIX)
- Operating System Concepts  
- Data Structures & Algorithms  
- Computer Graphics (fractals, rendering, math-heavy visuals)  
- Debugging & Memory Analysis  

---

## 🔧 Tech Stack

**Languages**
C, Bash, Python (basic), Markdown

**Tools**

Linux, Git, Valgrind, GDB, Makefile, Vim, VSCode


**Concepts I Care About**

Memory Safety
Process Lifecycle
File Descriptors
Pipes & Redirection
Error Handling
Clean Interfaces

## 📦 Featured Projects

- [`get_next_line`](https://github.com/ebxebx/42sg_get_next_line) – Read a file descriptor line by line  
- `pipex` – Recreate shell pipelines  
- `minishell` – Build a minimal shell  
- `philosophers` – Solve classic concurrency problem  
- `fract-ol` – Render fractals with smooth coloring  

> I prefer understanding **why** something works, not just **how**.

## 🧩 My Coding Philosophy

- Make it work  
- Make it correct  
- Make it simple  
- Then make it fast  

I value:
- Predictable behavior  
- Clear ownership of memory  
- Small functions with single responsibility  
- Meaningful error paths

## 📈 What I'm Working Toward

- Becoming a strong **systems / backend engineer**  
- Writing robust, maintainable C  
- Understanding OS internals deeply  
- Eventually exploring networking & security  

---

## 🌱 Fun Facts

- I enjoy explaining tricky concepts in both **English and Chinese**  
- I like turning hard problems into diagrams and mental models  
- I believe debugging is a superpower
